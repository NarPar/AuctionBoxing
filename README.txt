Auction Boxing is currently a work in progress.
Current features:
-Brawl: players begin with a set of items and simply duke it out. Good for testing items!

To-Do:
	Programming:
		-BitMasks for accurate pixel collision
		-Player Colors
		-projectile instances
		-Bowler Hat
		-jump punch
		-Victory taunts (Ministry of silly walks)
		-Kick (Ministry of silly walks)
		//-punch combo so can't dodge second punch? (Maybe)
		-Different levels
		-Auction
		-loadouts
	
	Art:
		-Bit mask assets for all state animations
		-Victory taunts (Ministry of silly walks)
		-Kick (Ministry of silly walks)
		--cane pull animation is them trying to claw back to their position (Being torn away off the stage)
bug:
-jump and punch not getting upper level set. (something to do with isFalling?)
-jump fall direction backwards
-hitting people when reloading (Not confirmed)

Items:
-daisy on suit that douses enemies in water, stunning them while they dry off
-Stop watch whip
-monacle laser (focussing lenseflare effect)
-boot charge (combo to run, button to tackle, button again to recover)
